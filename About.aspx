        <h1>Why Use Schedule Generator?</h1>

        <p>        
            At the University of Kansas, there are many courses and oftentimes, 
            students have to work to optimize their schedules to their needs and 
            preferences. The goal of the Class Schedule Generator is to provide 
            an automated process for schedule optimization by generating course 
            schedules based on user preferences. The Schedule Generator will use 
            course data from the University database and will allow users to choose 
            their courses, enter their constraints or preferences, and then 
            generate schedules that fit their needs.
